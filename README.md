# codec-python
A codec created with the python language

It is a program which allows to decrypt or encrypt any file with the help of an encryption key.

You must first select a text file containing a G4C matrix in it

This matrix must be in the form: G4C=[XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX]

Then you must choose a file to encrypt or decrypt, the decrypted file will be called REPONSE and the encrypted file REPONSE_CODE.

In the build folder you have a EPREUVE 1.txtc file which has been encrypted with this program and can be decrypted. Same for the EPREUVE 2.mp3c file.
